# Psych 755: Final Project
**Authors:** Huda Ahmed, Kenneth Diao, Sadaf Nasir

# Description

This is our final project for the class Psych 755 for the Data Science in Human Behavior (DSHB) program at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. We are using the 2022 edition of the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) dataset. Our outcome variable is `prolonged_covid_symptoms` (`covidsmp`), consisting of a binary response to the question: "Did you have any symptoms lasting 3 months or longer that you did not have prior to having coronavirus or COVID-19?" (1 = yes, 0 = no).

# Goals

The goal of this project is to apply machine learning methods (random forest & logistic regression) to predict the occurrence of long COVID symptoms in populations with chronic health conditions.

# Deliverables
1. Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in R/Quarto: this file will contain an initial cleaning and exploration of data in R.
2. Random Forest and Feature Importance Analysis in Python: this file will contain a Random Forest and Feature Importance Analysis whereby the predictor variables for our algorithm will be identified.
3. Logistic Regression in R/Quarto: this file will contain a Logistic Regression using a leave-one-out method to assess the importance of each predictor to the overall machine learning algorithm.
